My name is Anouar El Moumane. I am currently working to obtain my PhD ("DPhil") at the University of Oxford.
I am supervised by Jonathan Doye and also work closely with the group of Ard Louis.
In my research, I am mainly interested in statistical mechanics and soft matter.
Systems I am interested in include chemical and biological systems such as liquid crystals and macroscopic 
statistical systems such as human crowds. For my research, I use various tools and methods such as (Dynamical) 
Density Functional Theory.
Previously, I was at the Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, where I studied mathematics and physics. I also worked in the group of Hartmut Löwen, where I published my very first paper at the age of eighteen.
Outside of physics, I have various other passions, such as literature or playing piano.
I am also engaged in volunteer work and community service. Lately, I initiated and organized a fundraising project for war victims with UNICEF.
